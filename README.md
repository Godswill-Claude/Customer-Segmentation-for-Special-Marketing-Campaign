# Customer Segmentation for Special Marketing Campaign
This project uses K-Means clustering model building to segment thousands of customer records, grouping them for a special segmented offer or marketing campaign. 
This is an unsupervised learning problem.

## Dataset
The country dataset was used for this project. The downloaded csv file can be found in this project repository.

## Tools/Applications/Softwares/Packages Used for the Project
The python programming language, along with libraries such as Sci-kit learn, pandas, numpy, Seaborn and matplotlib, was used for the explorations and visualizations contained in this work.

## Key Insights for Analysis/Investigation
In this project, I endeavoured to find out the correct number of clusters or segments that the customers can be grouped into.

## Summary of Findings
It was found that the optimal number of clusters is 3.
However, with a Silhouette score of 0.5, we have an indication of possible room for improvement.
